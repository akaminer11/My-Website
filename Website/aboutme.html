                    Hi! I'm Andrew. I am age years old.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'm a computer geek/wannabe hacker. I hope to go to college and study CompSci or something like that. I do lots of stuff, and there are pictures of that stuff somewhere on this website.

                    <h1>How did I get into computers?</h1>
                </p>

                <p>
                    I've always liked testing the limits of the things around me. That naturally expanded to computers once I started using them. I was always fascinated by mods in minecraft and how they worked. That was probably my first exposure to actual programming. Then, I taught myself to code using online resources.

                    <h1>
                        CTFs
                    </h1>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The newest step in my computer journey has been hacking comptetitions called CTFs. Through CTFs, I have been able to discover more about computers and how they work than I ever would have otherwise. I HIGHLY recomend trying some beginner hacking challenges if you have any serious interest in programming or computers in general because they are just a good time.
