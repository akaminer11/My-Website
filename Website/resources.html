                This was where I first started learning code. They have courses on just about anything, and they have free courses on most mainstream things.

                OWASP has everything security related. It is super interesting. Don't worry if you don't understand have of what they're saying at first. I still barely understand what they're saying.

                If you are trying to learn something, chances are, someone has also learned that thing and posted a tutorial on youtube. Heck, maybe even post your own.

                If you have a question, someone has probably asked that question before. Learning to be a good googler is one of the key skills in programming and life in general.

                Probably the best place to learn algorithms. Lots of companies recruit through there, and most of the problems are interview questions for tech companies.
